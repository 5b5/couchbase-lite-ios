/** CBLSubdocument is a suboducment or a nested document with its own set of named properties. 
 In JSON terms it's a nested JSON Map object.
 Like CBLDocument, CBLSubdocument is mutable, so you can make changes in-place. The difference is
 that a subdocument doesn't have its own ID. It's not a first-class entity in the database, 
 it's just a nested object within the document's JSON. It can't be saved individually; changes are 
 persisted when you save its document.*/
