/** A compiled database query.
 You create a query by calling the CBLDatabase method createQueryWhere:. The query can be
 further configured by setting properties before running it. Some properties alter the
 behavior of the query enough to trigger recompilation; it's usually best to set these only
 once and then reuse the CBLQuery object. You can use NSPredicate / NSExpression variables
 to parameterize the query, making it flexible without needing recompilation. Then you just
 set the `parameters` property before running it. */

     As currently implemented, the result is two or more lines separated by newline characters:
