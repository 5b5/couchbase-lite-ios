# Couchbase Lite 2.0

**Couchbase Lite** is an embedded lightweight, document-oriented (NoSQL), syncable database engine.

Couchbase Lite 2.0 has a completely new set of APIs. The implementation is on top of [Couchbase Lite Core][1], which is also a new cross-platform implementation of database CRUD and query features, as well as document versioning.

THIS IS NOT A RELEASED PRODUCT. THIS IS NOT FINISHED CODE. This is currently in a very early stage of the implementation.
